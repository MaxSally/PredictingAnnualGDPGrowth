This project is a project for class CSCE 479 at University of Nebraska at Lincoln. 

This project focuses on predicting annual GDP growth of different countries based on various metrics such as population, real interest rates, economic freedom index, properties right index, etc. 

All the models built throughout the semester are under [source_code](/src) with different milestone folder showing the progress of the group over time. Results of each milestone are also included.
